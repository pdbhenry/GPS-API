# GPS-API

An API built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, meant to simulate the functionality of a GPS.

## Description

Location data (points on a 2D plane with Name & ID fields) are stored in a PostgreSQL table. Through CRUD operations, the API allows users to create/update/delete location data, 
as well as perform a variety of searches (get locations by ID, search locations within a circle range, find closest location to a point). A quadtree data structure has been 
implemented for its ability to organize spatial data. This significantly reduces the runtime of these search functions. As proof, most search functions have a "slow" 
counterpart (getLocsWithinCircle vs. getLocsWithinCircleSlow) in which searches are made simply by iterating through the repository's records.
